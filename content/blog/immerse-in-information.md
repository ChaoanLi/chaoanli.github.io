# Surround Yourself with the Information You Want

I've never been particularly good at English, especially vocabulary. Memorizing words has always been painful for me, and my pronunciation still isn't great.

However, after spending a year in the United States, I've noticed many things have naturally become more standard. It's simply because I've been forcibly immersed in that environment.

Similarly, I've gradually developed a feeling: when you want to do something or get closer to a certain field, find ways to surround yourself with that information. Whether it's through WeChat official accounts, short videos, taking classes, reading books, listening to podcasts, or joining various groups. There's a passive improvement effect.

From now on, curate your own information feed.
Then try to save the things you really love!
I will try RSSHub and Folo.

# 被你想要的信息包围

其实一直以来英语都学的不是很明白，特别是单词，每次背单词特别痛苦，到现在发音也不太行。

但是来美国一年后，发现很多东西无形之中变得比较标准，其实就是因为被强制的浸泡在环境中了。

同理，逐渐有一种感觉，当你想要做某件事儿，或者靠近某个领域的时候，想办法让自己被这些信息包围。公众号呀，短视频呀，上课也好，或者书，播客，加各种群也好。会有一种被动提升的效应。

从现在开始定制自己的信息流。
然后尝试保存一些非常喜欢的东西！
我准备试试RSSHub+ Folo.
