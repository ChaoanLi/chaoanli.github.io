# Everyone Should Productize Themselves

I've been looking for internships recently. Once again, I'm experiencing what it's like to ford a river yourself. Some people say you should do it this way, others say that way. Since that's the case, let me join the chorus of advice-givers too, even though I haven't found an internship yet ⑧.

A theory I've encountered divides this into four quadrants: people who know you or don't know you, and one-to-one versus one-to-many approaches.

Applying to strangers in a one-to-many way is mass job applications - this is Stage 1;
Applying to people you know in a one-to-one way is networking - this is Stage 2;
Applying to strangers in a one-to-one way is cold outreach - this is Stage 3;
Applying to people you know in a one-to-many way is productizing yourself - this is Stage 4.

Most people are at Stage 1, mass applying with barely any responses.
Then everyone starts moving to Stage 2, frantically connecting and asking on LinkedIn.
Some people reach Stage 3, cold messaging HRs to recommend themselves.
Those at Stage 4 are rare - they productize themselves. Actually, everyone has their own advantages, whether it's the books they've read, projects they've done. Like me, I'm a little hoarder who loves collecting all sorts of tools, websites, and learning various workflows. All of these can actually be productized. When people around you think of you and remember you, there may be more possibilities - collaborations, hangouts, job opportunities, and so on. Of course, this might sacrifice some privacy, so it's up to individual judgment.

# 每个人都应该做产品化

最近在找实习。又一次感觉到小马过河的体验。有人说你应该这样，有人说应该那样。既然如此，没有找到实习的我也好为人师一下⑧。

目前接触的一个理论是分为四个象限，你认识的人或者不认识的人，一对一还是一对多。

![求职四象限](./job-search-quadrants.png)

向不认识的人一对多求职是海投简历，这是第一阶段；
向认识的人一对一求职是network，这是第二阶段；
向不认识的人一对一求职是自荐，这是第三阶段；
向认识的人一对多求职是把自己产品化，这是第四阶段。

大部分人在第一阶段，海投基本没回复。
然后大家开始去第二阶段，在LinkedIn上疯狂链接询问。
有一部分人去第三阶段，私信HR毛遂自荐。
第四阶段的人是少数，把自己产品化，其实大家都有自己的优势，可能是读的书，做的项目，像我就是个小囤囤鼠，喜欢搜集乱七八糟的工具，网页，学一些workflow。这些其实都可以产品化。让身边的人想起你，记得你，也许就会有更多的可能性，可以是合作，可以是一起玩，可以是招工作什么的。当然啦，感觉会牺牲掉自己的隐私，所以见仁见智吧。
