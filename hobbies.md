<br>Badminton is the sport that relaxes me the most. In the college badminton competition, we achieved a good result, ranking 3rd-4th place.

## Mountain Hiking

<br>Mountain climbing is another hobby of mine. It not only allows me to appreciate the scenery, but also lets me experience the process of continuous climbing, just like mathematics. I want to climb the five famous mountains in China and Huangshan. If my body allows, I would like to go to Mount Everest to have a look.

## DOTA2

<br>Many people may think that playing games is not good, but I don't think so. Dota 2 is indeed one of my most important ways to relax. Going to the live event of The International in 2019 was one of the most exciting things for me. At the same time, the LCANIUBI 2.0 team that I formed with my high school classmates achieved the championship of the Chinese regional level 3 Warrior League.
