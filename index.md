<img src="https://chaoanli.github.io/chaoan.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Chaoan Li (李朝安)**.

I am a master student majoring in **Pure Mathematical** at Beijing Normal University. Currently, I work as a research assistant in the Innovative Intellectual Base for Pure Mathematical, Harmonic Analysis and its Applications, advised by [Prof. Dachun Yang](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~dcyang/index.html).

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *cali@mail.bnu.edu.cn*

## Research Interests

- Applied Mathematics
- Financial Mathematics
- Machine Learning and Language Model

My research primarily focuses on **the real-variable theories of various function spaces**, such as (classical, variable, mixed-norm, weighted) Lebesgue spaces, Hardy spaces, and Triebel—Lizorkin spaces. I have developed comprehensive theories of **anisotropic Hardy-type spaces associated with ball quasi-Banach spaces**.
At the PhD level, I would like to use my foundation in pure mathematics to pursue **more applied research**. This includes things like Financial Math, Operations Theory and Machine Learning. I hope I can do something meaningful for the society through my research results.
